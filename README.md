# The Next Episode

Do you like watching TV shows? If you do, The Next Episode will come in handy. The Next Episode allows users to track TV shows they are currently watching or have watched. To save a TV show to their profile, users can browse from a list of popular TV shows or search for a specific show, then just click Save! Users can also review and rate the TV shows they have saved, so if they ever want to rewatch shows, they'll know where to start.

The Next Episode is a web application built using a Rails API for the backend and JavaScript, React for the [frontend](https://github.com/caicindy87/the-next-episode-client).
